# Commercial Website

The goal of this website is to sell a product or service with multiple price points.  For simplicity we will be using 3 different options.  Invent cool names later, for now just refer to them as **A, B, and C**.  We will be importing some bootstraps to handling the resizing of the page.

### The Boot Template
Create a new file named **comercial.html**.  Add a header with a title to your website.  Underneath the header make a section.  Inside that section place a div.  Inside that div add three more divs.  This is a picture of the family three

<pre>
----<section class="container">
--------<div class= "row">
------------<div class="col-12 col-lg-4"></div>
------------<div class="col-12 col-lg-4"></div>
------------<div class="col-12 col-lg-4"></div>
--------/</div>
----</section>
</pre>


Inside each of the divs, give each a h3, p, h3, and a button that says buy.
